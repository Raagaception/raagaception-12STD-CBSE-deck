[AnkiWeb page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1981482084) | [Latest Release](https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck/releases/latest) | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kbSXsRTUC2)

> **Author's Note as of July 2024**: This deck, despite being extensive and useful in it's own right, has syllabus gaps here and there, given that the CBSE/JEE/NEET syllabus is a massive ocean. Also, this deck was created in 2021; and there won't be any new further updates or additions to this project, since the we, the original authors of this repo don't have the time to maintain it or merge pull requests anymore. Users are recommended to use their own discretion to fine-tune the topics they wish to study from this deck according to the latest syllabus. Volunteers who are willing to fork and continue this project independently are welcome. Decks and resources of a similar nature, unaffiliated with this project, may be used to fullfil the gaps in knowledge left by this deck. A few such supplementary decks are listed below:

## Getting started
First-time here? Welcome! üëã Following all the steps given below will get you up and running.

### Getting the Deck via CrowdAnki (recommended)

#### Step 1: Installing Anki and setting up the CrowdAnki addon

1. New to Anki? You need to first set up the program.
	- Go over to the [AnkiWeb website](http://ankisrs.net/), scroll down, download the latest version for your operating system, and install it on your PC.
1. In order to install and later upgrade _Raagaception's 12STD CBSE Deck_, you'll need to first install an Anki add-on called "CrowdAnki".
	- Open Anki on your computer, go to the ``Tools`` menu and select ``Add-ons``.
	- In the dialog box, click on ``Get Add-ons...`` and paste in the following code : ``1788670778``
	- Click on ``OK`` to install the add-on, and close the Anki program.

#### Step 2: Installing the deck from repository

1. Open Anki, go to the ``File`` menu and select ``CrowdAnki: Import git repository``.
1. In the dialog box, paste in the link to this repository : ``https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck``. Wait for a little while as CrowdAnki imports the deck for you. **Don't panic if Windows shows that Anki isn't responding**, just give it time.
1. Don't change anything in the _CrowdAnki Import Settings_ dialog box that opens; just press ``OK`` to start the import. A dialog box should then confirm that the import was successful.
1. The deck must now be visible on your profile. Close Anki fully and reopen it before doing anything else.

### Importing the ``.apkg`` Deck file directly

1. New to Anki? You need to first set up the program.
	- Go over to the [AnkiWeb website](http://ankisrs.net/), scroll down, download the latest version for your operating system, and install it on your PC.
1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck/releases/latest), and expand the "Assets" section at the bottom.
1. Download the file ``raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck-v1.3.0.apkg``, and double click when downloaded. It should open up and get imported to Anki automatically.

### Selectively studying from desired topics
You don't need to study everything in the deck, just study what you WANT to; since the deck is painstakingly arranged topic-by-topic, and chapter-by-chapter.
Here's how to go about studying by utilizing that to your advantage :
1. Open the "Browse" window and scroll down the left pane.
1. Under the ``Decks`` section, click on ``Raagaception's 12STD CBSE Deck``. This will now display a list of the thousands of cards available in the deck.
1. Select all cards in browser with ``(Ctrl+A)``, then suspend ALL the cards in the deck - this will result in none of the cards showing up in your review queue. Note that all suspended cards are represented in the browser as yellowed-out cards.
1. Expand the ``Raagaception's 12STD CBSE Deck`` listing by using the arrow icon. Keep expanding the list to reveal more and more subtopics.
1. When you find the ones you want to unsuspend, select the listing, which will bring up the cards from **that topic only**. Press ``Ctrl+A`` to select all cards in the browser, and ``Ctrl+J`` to unsuspend them. 
1. You can now close the browser and review the cards normally, until you wish to unlock newer topics. To do that, just repeat all the steps from step 4).

### Setting up the review settings

If you're a beginner to Anki, I recommend watching [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/uLfczzq9z_8) to fully understand how Anki functions, and what settings for the learning algorithm might be the best for you. It's pretty long, but trust me, it will help you understand how the Anki review settings actually work.

1. After watching the above video, click the tiny ‚öôÔ∏è icon to the right side of the deck name, and click ``Options`` to view the current review settings. 
You'll notice that the deck comes pre-packaged with what I believe are optimal settings for studying the cards in this deck over a long period of time (for example, if you are six months away from your next major exam). If you're a beginner, consider this as a baseline preset for your convenience. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/GBPnCuy.png)
Sadly, there are no one-size-fits-all settings, so as you learn, just clone the preset and tweak them to best suit your study style. But there are certain settings which are compulsory for everyone to stick by for this deck, which you shouldn't change at any cost :
	- **Maximum reviews/day** = ``9999``
	- **Insertion order** = ``Random``
	- **Leech Action** = ``Tag Only``
	- **New card sort order** = ``Random``
	- **Review sort order** = ``Due date, then random``
1. Next, go to ``Tools > Preferences ...`` and navigate to the ``Scheduling`` tab. Change the two below settings as given :
	- **V3 scheduler** = ``On``
	- **Learn ahead limit** = ``0``

... and you're done with your review settings!

## Updating to a new version of the deck

1. Keep in mind that updating the deck **OVERWRITES** all edits and structural changes you might have made to the deck on your end.
1. To update, follow the same steps as [**installing the deck from repository**](#step-2-installing-the-deck-from-repository)
1. You may be left with some empty subdecks; simply delete any empty decks which you see. 
2. Also, change your review settings preset back from our default settings to your personal settings preset, if you wish.

## \[Obsolete\] Contributing your own cards and edits to this deck

As of ``v1.3.0``, contributions to the deck are hereby closed. The instructions below are purely left for posterity; if someone forks this project and continues it, they may copy paste these steps for users to submit updates.

Since this deck uses [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki), anyone with a GitHub account can help in correcting errors on cards and adding new cards from topics which are not already covered in the deck. If you're inclined to sincerely do so, then read on.

### Setting up your GitHub account and GitHub desktop

1. If you're completely new to GitHub, you need to [sign up for a new account](https://github.com/signup). For the purpose of this tutorial, I'll be using a dummy account by the name of ``Demo-User-42069``.
1. Next, download and install [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 
1. Open GitHub desktop, and go to ``File > Options`` and click on ``Sign in``. Hit ``Continue with Browser`` on the next dialogue window.
1. This will open your browser. Choose ``GitHubDesktop.exe`` and click ``Open Link``. Click ``Authorise`` on the subsequent browser dialogue.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/MEimTAu.png)
1. Click ``Clone a respository from the Internet``, and enter the URL of this repo, that is, ``https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck``. Specify the directory where you wish to clone the repository. 
	- For example, I'm going with ``C:\GitHub Repositories\raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck``. 
		![](https://i.imgur.com/1LWdFzW.png)

### Exporting as JSON via CrowdAnki
1. Now comes the slightly confusing part - exporting with CrowdAnki from Anki. Open Anki, and read carefully.
	- If you've just **edited** some errors on the cards from the public deck, then directly proceed to step 3.
	- If you wish to add **new cards** to this deck, then put your cards into individual decks categorized by subtopics (try to categorize them to the best of your ability, we'll manage the rest during review). Create a new deck with your account's name, put the subtopic decks under that. Now put the deck with your GitHub username under ``9.GitHub Contributions Held for Review``.
		- For example, if your GitHub profile URL is ``github.com/Demo-User-42069``, and you want to contribute two decks, namely ``Inorganic Group-16 NCERT`` and ``Vectors JEE``, both meant for JEE aspirants, then this is what your structure more or less should look like : 
		  ![](https://i.imgur.com/zL5Xc1o.png)
		  **Please don't put your contributions under any other section, otherwise they'll get overwritten by updates.**
1. Click the tiny ‚öôÔ∏è icon to the right of _Raagaception's 12STD CBSE Deck_, and click ``Export``. 
2. Change the export format to ``CrowdAnki JSON representation (*directory)`` 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/suu5qSQ.png)
1. Make sure all settings look exactly like the image below, then hit ``Export...``
	![](https://i.imgur.com/8xXzv82.png)
1. Export into any directory you wish, and remember the location. 

### Creating a fork and committing changes
1. Go to the export location, change the name ``deck.json`` to ``raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck.json``. Then copy all the folder contents. 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/LCCK7Oy.png)
1. Open GitHub desktop, and click ``Show in Explorer`` 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/kmJmG9M.png). 
1. Paste the copied files there, and select ``Replace the files in the destination`` when prompted. 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/Bpji4ck.png)
1. Now when you open GitHub desktop again, you'll see something like this : 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/dtcw3rM.png)
1. In the bottom right corner, click ``Create a fork``, and click ``Fork this respository`` on the subsequent dialogue box.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/zLD5PXg.png)
1. Select ``To contribute to the parent project`` and click ``Continue``
	![](https://i.imgur.com/eKvS7EV.png)
1. In the bottom right corner, write a heading and description and feel free to describe your contribution in detail, which will help us in categorizing it. Then click ``Commit to main``
	![](https://i.imgur.com/lh2rSUP.png)

### Pushing your changes to our repository for review
1. Whenever you're ready to finally submit your contribution to us on GitHub, click ``Push Origin``
	![](https://i.imgur.com/DRbb2ni.png)
1. Open GitHub, and go to your **forked** repository. In my case, it's named ``demo-user-42069/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck``. Click ``Contribute`` and then click ``Open pull request``.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/OC9Mv7D.png)
1. Click ``Create Pull Request`` 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/QXPdkhC.png)
1. Make sure ``Allow edits by maintainers`` is ticked, then ``Create Pull Request``.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/5mO9xJ0.png)

When you see the following screen, you've successfully submitted your contribution. Congratulations! Wait a few days for us to review and categorize it, and then your contribution will get included in the next update. ![](https://i.imgur.com/LrvZZyy.png)

## \[Obselete\] MathJax render script for AnkiWeb users

If you wish to review your cards on the browser version of AnkiWeb, the MathJax equations in any cards won't get rendered. But by adding the following code to the front and back of the "Basic - Raagaception" and "Cloze - Raagaception" card templates, AnkiWeb will render your MathJax for you : 
```css
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.processSectionDelay = 0;
MathJax.Hub.Config({
messageStyle:"none",
showProcessingMessages:false,
tex2jax:{
inlineMath: \[ \['$','$'\], \['\\\\(','\\\\)'\] \],
displayMath: \[ \['$$','$$'\], \['\\\\\[','\\\\\]'\] \],
processEscapes:true
}
});
MathJax.Ajax.config.path\["mhchem"\] =
"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax-mhchem/3.3.2";
MathJax.Hub.Config({
TeX: {
extensions: \["\[mhchem\]/mhchem.js"\]
}
});
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {
if (window.MathJax != null) {
var card = document.querySelector('.card');
MathJax.Hub.Queue(\['Typeset', MathJax.Hub, card\]);
return;
}
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.type = 'text/javascript';
script.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS\_SVG-full';
document.body.appendChild(script);
})();
</script>
```

This code was included in the initial versions of the deck but discontinued from v0.9.0 onwards to maximize compatibility, since on versions of Anki 2.1.40 or lower, this JavaScript [causes a rendering error](https://i.imgur.com/KfQRJZZ.png). Hence if you need the functionality, and you use Anki version 2.1.42+, you can manually add it yourself.
